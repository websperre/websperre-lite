# Websperre Lite

**Websperre Lite** is almost the same thing as regular [Websperre](https://github.com/websperre/websperre/) with the only exceptions being:

- There is no unlock key or password associated to the block list.
- Block list is not encoded or shuffled and is stored in plaintext.

Websperre Lite is a less "restrictive" version of Websperre.
